What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n","\n","- > Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line, while compiled languages translate the entire code into machine language before execution.\n","\n","2. What is exception handling in Python?\n","\n","- > Exception handling in Python allows you to catch and handle runtime errors using try-except blocks.\n","\n","3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n","\n","- > The finally block is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.\n","\n","4. What is logging in Python?\n","\n","- > Logging in Python is a way to track events that happen during execution using the logging module.\n","\n","5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","\n","- > The __del__ method is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed.\n","\n","6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n","\n","- > import imports the whole module, while from ... import imports specific functions or classes.\n","\n","7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n","\n","- > You can handle multiple exceptions using multiple except blocks or by grouping exceptions in a tuple.\n","\n","8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n","\n","- > The with statement simplifies file handling by automatically managing file closing.\n","\n","9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n","\n","- > Multithreading runs multiple threads within the same process; multiprocessing runs multiple processes.\n","\n","10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n","\n","- > Logging helps in tracking events, debugging, and monitoring software behavior.\n","\n","11. What is memory management in Python?\n","\n","- > Memory management in Python involves allocation and deallocation of memory using automatic garbage collection.\n","\n","12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n","\n","- > Basic steps include try, except, else, and finally blocks to catch and handle exceptions.\n","\n","13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n","\n","- > Efficient memory management ensures better performance and prevents memory leaks.\n","\n","14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n","\n","- > try block contains code that may raise exceptions; except block handles the exception.\n","\n","15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n","\n","- > Python uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to free unused memory.\n","\n","16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n","\n","- > The else block runs if no exceptions occur in the try block.\n","\n","17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n","\n","- > Common logging levels are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n","\n","18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n","\n","- > os.fork() creates a child process, while multiprocessing uses a more cross-platform safe method.\n","\n","19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n","\n","- > Closing a file ensures resources are freed and data is written properly.\n","\n","20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n","\n","- > file.read() reads the entire file; file.readline() reads one line at a time.\n","\n","21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n","\n","- > The logging module is used for tracking events during a program's execution.\n","\n","22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n","\n","- > The os module provides functions to interact with the operating system like file handling.\n","\n","23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n","\n","- > Challenges include memory leaks, fragmentation, and managing limited resources.\n","\n","24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n","\n","- > You can raise an exception manually using the raise keyword.\n","\n","25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n","\n","- > Multithreading improves performance and responsiveness in applications with concurrent tasks."],"metadata":{"id":"zf5QHK2h0VEw"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Practical Questions and Answers"],"metadata":{"id":"JLNPCetD3dOI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.
